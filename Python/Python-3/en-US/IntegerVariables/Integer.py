"""

To declare a variable, just structure it as
$ID = $VALUE

NOTICE: $ID should be descriptive, not vague. Why descriptive?
Because if you have it be vague, leave your code for a while, 
and then come back to it, with $ID being vague, you won't know
what the hell $ID was supposed to be.

myint = 7	# Variable 'myint' is set to '7'
print(myint)	# Prints the value of 'myint'
